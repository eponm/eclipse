Notes and documentation for technical direction of a large and confusing dance production

### ...what?
I'm half of the pair of Technical Directors for a 120-person dance show in the spring, and it's the first time we're doing this! We're starting nearly from scratch, so this repository will function as a kind of process journal for us. We'll see how useful it becomes â€” and hopefully it'll help someone else out, too.
