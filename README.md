A process journal about the technical direction of a large and confusing dance production, and a guide on how to make it run smoother than it ever has. Hopefully.

### What?
I'm half of the pair of Technical Directors for a 120-person dance show in the spring, and it's the first time we're doing this job. We're starting the whole process of being TDs nearly from scratch, since we haven't been provided with any documentation of previous years' runs, so the idea is that this repository will function as a kind of journal for us to make sense of things.

Hopefully this will end up being generic enough to apply to many kinds of large shows, but the unavoidable reality is that it *will* end up being dance-flavored. At the very least, it's something to pass on to the production's future TDs.

### Your first time, you say?
Rest assured, we both have plenty of theatre experience. The production itself is an annual tradition, and this is the first time that we're its TDs. This year's TD is going to be an ocean away (literally) by the time next year's produciton rolls around, so we're hoping to be as prepared as possible for every sort of mania and confusion entailed by the show.
